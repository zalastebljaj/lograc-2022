# Regular languages and finite-state automata

This file contains a single project.

## Goals of the project

* Define [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Formal_language_theory), 
  [regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language) and 
  [finite state automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
  
* Study the relationship between these.

* A simpler version of this project will establish the fact that a
  lanuage is regular if, and only if, it is recognised by a
  non-deterministic finite-state automaton.
  
* A more advanced version will also prove additional properties of
  regular languages, such as closedness under complementation and
  intersection.
